# BackgroundRemoval

It is project for Background Removal. Overview of datasets and approaches for this task are in the file `Background Removal.pdf`. We based this project on [U2-Net model]() and [CascadePSP]().

Before running code you need to download U2Net model from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ao1ovG1Qtx4b7EoskHXmi2E9rp5CHLcZ/view) and save it in `./`.  The CascadePSP model was taken from [this](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jchungaa_connect_ust_hk/EW7CBmiBK9RJlmORaEpXRg4B4gZ0GtU3L6K64oFdD-GKWw?e=q0Tg5p). It should be save as `model_folde/model`.


File `BackgroundRemoval.ipynb` contains simple interface for Background Removal.


For runing research part you need to download the following datasets: [DUTS](http://saliencydetection.net/duts/), [DUT-OMRON](https://vk.com/away.php?to=http%3A%2F%2Fsaliencydetection.net%2Fdut-omron%2F%23org96c3bab&cc_key=) and [ECSSD](https://vk.com/away.php?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cse.cuhk.edu.hk%2F%7Eleojia%2Fprojects%2Fhsaliency%2Fdataset.html&cc_key=).

File `Picture without background.ipynb` contains experiment under chosen models.
